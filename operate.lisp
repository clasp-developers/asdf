     "Operate does mainly four things for the user:

1. Resolves the OPERATION designator into an operation object.
   OPERATION is typically a symbol denoting an operation class, instantiated with MAKE-OPERATION.
2. Resolves the COMPONENT designator into a component object.
   COMPONENT is typically a string or symbol naming a system, loaded from disk using FIND-SYSTEM.
3. It then calls MAKE-PLAN with the operation and system as arguments.
4. Finally calls PERFORM-PLAN on the resulting plan to actually build the system.

The entire computation is wrapped in WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT and error handling code.
If a VERSION argument is supplied, then operate also ensures that the system found satisfies it
using the VERSION-SATISFIES method.
If a PLAN-CLASS argument is supplied, that class is used for the plan.

The :FORCE or :FORCE-NOT argument to OPERATE can be:
  T to force the inside of the specified system to be rebuilt (resp. not),
    without recursively forcing the other systems we depend on.
  :ALL to force all systems including other systems we depend on to be rebuilt (resp. not).
  (SYSTEM1 SYSTEM2 ... SYSTEMN) to force systems named in a given list
:FORCE-NOT has precedence over :FORCE; builtin systems cannot be forced.

For backward compatibility, all keyword arguments are passed to MAKE-OPERATION
when instantiating a new operation, that will in turn be inherited by new operations.
But do NOT depend on it, for this is deprecated behavior."))
