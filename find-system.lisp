        You are using ASDF version ~A ~:[(probably from (require \"asdf\") ~

        ~:[(and older than 2.27 at that)~;~:*~A~] registered at ~S. ~
        Having an ASDF installed and registered is the normal way of configuring ASDF to upgrade itself, ~
        and having an old version registered is a configuration error. ~
        ASDF will ignore this configured system rather than downgrade itself. ~
        In the future, you may want to either: ~
        (a) upgrade this configured ASDF to a newer version, ~
        (b) install a newer ASDF and register it in front of the former in your configuration, or ~
        (c) uninstall or unregister this and any other old version of ASDF from your configuration. ~
        Note that the older ASDF might be registered implicitly through configuration inherited ~
        from your system installation, in which case you might have to specify ~
        :ignore-inherited-configuration in your in your ~~/.config/common-lisp/source-registry.conf ~
        or other source-registry configuration file, environment variable or lisp parameter. ~
        Indeed, a likely offender is an obsolete version of the cl-asdf debian or ubuntu package, ~
        that you might want to upgrade (if a recent enough version is available) ~
        or else remove altogether (since most implementations ship with a recent asdf); ~
        if you lack the system administration rights to upgrade or remove this package, ~
        then you might indeed want to either install and register a more recent version, ~
        or use :ignore-inherited-configuration to avoid registering the old one. ~
        Please consult ASDF documentation and/or experts.~@:>~%"
