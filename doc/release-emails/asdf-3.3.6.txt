Today we release ASDF 3.3.6, the sixth bugfix release for the 3.3 release series, and -- it is devoutly to be hoped -- the final one.

We urge implementations that are currently bundling previous versions of ASDF -- and especially those bundling 3.3.0 through 3.3.5 -- to upgrade to 3.3.6 at their earliest convenience.

As maintainer, my primary role continues to be coordination and some limited quality control.  The real work for this release has been done by many contributors and bug-reporters, to whom the Common Lisp community owes a tremendous vote of thanks.  Their names are listed on the Changelog, appended below.

We *hope* that the next release will be 3.4, introducing new functionality but which, as the numbering suggests, will be backward compatible.

Best,
Robert
