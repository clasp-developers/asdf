In honor of Valentine's Day, and more honestly, just because it's overdue, today we release ASDF 3.3.4, the fourth bugfix release for the 3.3 release series.

We urge implementations that are currently bundling previous versions of ASDF -- and especially those bundling 3.3.0 or 3.3.1 -- to upgrade to 3.3.4 at their earliest convenience.  This is especially true for SBCL, for which 3.3.4 fixes a bug preventing ASDF upgrade from working smoothly.

Immense thanks, as always, to Faré Rideau.  Also thanks to the many bug reporters and patch submitters including (alphabetically):

*  Rommel Martinez
*  Jan Moringen
*  Karsten Poeck
*  François-René Rideau
*  Martin Simmons
*  Eric Timmons
*  Guillaume Le Vaillant
