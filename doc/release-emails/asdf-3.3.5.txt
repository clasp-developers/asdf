Today we release ASDF 3.3.5, the fifth bugfix release for the 3.3 release series.

We urge implementations that are currently bundling previous versions of ASDF -- and especially those bundling 3.3.0 or 3.3.1 -- to upgrade to 3.3.5 at their earliest convenience.  In addition to fixes that are generally applicable, there are fixes for ECL, LispWorks, and SBCL.

As maintainer, my primary role has been coordination and some limited quality control.  The real work for this release has been done by many contributors and bug-reporters, to whom the Common Lisp community owes a tremendous vote of thanks.  Their names are listed on the Changelog, appended below.

We *hope* that the next release will be 3.4, introducing new functionality but which, as the numbering suggests, will be backward compatible.

Best,
Robert
