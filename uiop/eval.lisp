It initially implements the syntax specified by the CLHS, but may also have implementation-specific
extensions, and may grow user-defined extensions. You MUST ONLY make conservative extensions to it:
  A- No one may at any point modify any standard character in any way.
  B- No two dependencies may assign different meaning to the same non-standard character.
    Using any non-standard character while expecting the implementation to treat some way
    counts as such an assignment of meaning (e.g. using CCL's #$ syntax for FFI).
  C- Libraries need to document these assignments of meaning to non-standard characters.
  D- Free software libraries will register these changes on:
